# WT TEST DRIVER

AGui for test driving any WarThunder vehicle based on [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0)

## Usage/Examples

I would suggest you watch [Ask3lad's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0) before running this as it may help with troubleshooting issues later on

---
# RUNNING FROM SOURCE

1. download the zip from this repository.
2. install dependencies via `npm install`
3. run using `npm run` or build a binary using `npm run make` (i have only supplied windows binary so if ypu plan on running this on mac or linux i would suggest building your own)

---
# Running binary

1. Run `warthunder-testdrive-gui-1.0.0 Setup.exe` from the releases tab.


On first startup the program checks if you have Wt installed with WT launcher if not it will prompt you for your warthunder install directory e.g. **C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\WarThunder** or the steam install directory e.g. **A:\Steam\steamapps\common\War Thunder**, this works on windows, linux and mac

The program automatically loads your misisons from the usermissions folder in the warthunder directory, you just select the mission you want to edit, then click edit, select a vehicle and then load the mission in WarThunder
